cross-tools makes setting up a new cross compiler for barebones OS development
easier. A safe set of configuration options has been chosen for each of the
program that you need for building for your target platform.

By default, (i.e., just running 'make'), it will install:
* GNU Binutils
* GCC
* GDB

The default target host triple is arm-none-eabi. You can change this target by
setting the TARGET variable for make:

    make [target] TARGET=mipsel

You can install the tools for multiple host targets by running 'make clean' in
between each target. The tools for each target will all be installed along side
each-other.

The default installation location is $PWD/local-prefix. You can change the
installation location by setting the PREFIX variable for make:

    make [target] PREFIX=/usr/local
